###MILESTONE 02###

Chosen paragraph:

“Beyond the mammoth cases, ##a pileup of other large payouts has padded the tab##, a Times analysis of city payouts found. 

While the ##total number of payouts has dipped over time##, 

the ##average amount has increased.##

Last budget year, the city paid out 30 settlements of $1 million or more — five times as many as a decade before.”
